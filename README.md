My digital garden. 

## initial thoughts
So,here we go. Today I read about the idea of a digital garden
and it deeply resonated with me. The thing is that I have been thinking
about publishing things and thoughts to the web for years now. I have
been producing stuff here and there, but somehow always kept myself from fully
jumping in. Maybe this won't be different and this will die down in a couple 
of weeks or months. But maybe not, maybe this is finally the form that I have 
been looking for. Certainly feels like it. 

The fact, that I can write this from my phone makes me think that I found a concept 
flexible enough for my daily routine. Because I won't always be able to write from a
computer and I want things like that. But at the same time, I want or rather need
to be able to access this project anytime I want slash need. 

## tech stack
Git is definitely a core tool for me. The ability to branch out, try things while at 
the same time documenting and logging everything is great. 

For now, this will be mainly markdown files in folders and I will later decide on their 
presentation. 

I come from a React background and I would love to work on a Next.js project, so I might
do that. Then again, I will start a new job next week where I will learn Vue.js. Which is 
exciting too. Maybe I could do both and see how they compare. 

Or do something else. What I am set on is Git and .md files, the rest is cosmetics. 

## motivation
Why do this? I am convinced that learning in public is the way to go. Because I am scared 
shitless by the thought. So the idea of starting a blog has floated around my head for a 
long time, but it never felt right. A blog was too confined. I am not in the habit of 
publishing articles. Maybe a wiki, but that seemed too overwhelming to begin. 

The picture of a garden is perfect. (Although as things are right now, I am a terrible 
gardener IRL.) One problem with a blog was always to pick a specific topic. But I have 
many interests. I work with code, used to play in a band, am passionate about food and its 
preparation, run around 100km in a month, used to teach German as a foreign language, 
try to improve my drawing and photography skills, am working on loosing weight and get into
bodyweight fitness. Try finding a tag line for that blog. 

So a garden is perfect. There can be different corners and plazas for different topics. 
They can be linked or they can be isolated from each other.

One thing I regret about my old job is not taking notes and documenting snippets. 

See, I am a serial career changer. I have no degree or vocational education. It's all patches 
and DIY. In order to improve and solidify the things I am learning, I need to put things down 
in my own words. Otherwise I will forget about them. That's what this garden is going to be.
