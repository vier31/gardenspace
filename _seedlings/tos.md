## TOS 
While I strive to get all my facts right, I am still a human being and am prone to make mistakes. 
If you find that I got something wrong, please let me know. I am always willing to learn. 

The easiest way to do this is probably to just open a pull request. 

At the same time, it is important to note, that there are facts and there are opinions. If you find,
that you disagree with my opinion, please note that I am willing to discuss arguments, but I can't promise
to change my opinion.
