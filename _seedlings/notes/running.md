# Running

For a long time, running was something I dreaded. 
I was out of shape and I was unable to run for a minute. 

I remember one time as a older teen, we were running to catch a bus and I was helplessly out of breath. 
This was due to me smoking back then. 

At the same time, I always had this thought to get good at meditation. It was something I felt I needed to do. 
But I never got myself to sit down for a prolonged period of time. 

In 2014 I in was visiting my father, who got into running and ran an hour long run a couple of times a week at that time. 
When I joined him that time, I was wearing Vans slippers and swim shorts, because I didn't have appropriate clothes for running.
2 minutes into the run, I gave up. Although I gave up smoking in 2011, I still was badly out of shape. But I swore that I would get better. 
The fact that my father, 30 years older than me, was able to run for that amount of time, while I was coughing my lungs out, was not okay. 
So I vowed that I would get in shape and pick up running. 

Now in 2021, I am capable of running 15 km in a decent time.
