# How I got into running for good

I had been running for over two years before, but I never warmed up to it really. 
When I came across the C25K subreddit and saw many happy runner praising this program, I decided to give it a try. 

It was the slow progression, giving me time to process my body's reaction to the exercise and seeing how ending a workout with hunger for more instead of feeling completely exhausted changed my perception of the experience. I realized that running is not about going as fast as possible every single time, but about consistency and routine.
