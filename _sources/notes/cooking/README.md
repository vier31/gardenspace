# Cooking
I love cooking and have been thinking about sharing thoughts and recipes for a while now. 

At the same time I don't like social media, so an Instagram channel or something like that is not something I want. 
Here I want to collect recipes I cook on a regular basis, take pictures and get deeper into the science behind cooking.
